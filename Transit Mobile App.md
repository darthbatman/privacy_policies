# Privacy Policy

This app uses the user's location while the app is in use to find bus stops near the user. The user's location is not used or stored when the user is not using the app.

This app uses the 3rd party service AdMob to serve ads within the app. Through AdMob, third parties may be placing and reading cookies on your usersâ€™ browsers, or using web beacons to collect information as a result of ad serving on this application.

The Advertising Identifier (IDFA) is a unique ID for each iOS device and is the only way to offer targeted ads. Users can choose to limit ad targeting on their iOS device.

This app uses the Advertising Identifier through AdMob and respects the Limit Ad Tracking setting.

The user data stored on the app is limited to the user's list of favorited stops. No user data is stored outside of the application itself. The user's list of favorite stops will be retained until the app is deleted. If the app is deleted, the user's list of favorite stops, which is all the user data the app stores, will be deleted.
