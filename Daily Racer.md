This app uses the 3rd party service AdMob to serve ads within the app. Through AdMob, third parties may be placing and reading cookies on your usersâ€™ browsers, or using web beacons to collect information as a result of ad serving on this application.

The Advertising Identifier (IDFA) is a unique ID for each iOS device and is the only way to offer targeted ads. Users can choose to limit ad targeting on their iOS device.

This app uses the Advertising Identifier through AdMob and respects the Limit Ad Tracking setting.

The user data stored on the app is limited to the user's game data. No additional user data is stored outside of the application itself. The user's game data will be retained until the app is deleted. If the app is deleted, the user's game data, which is all the user data the app stores, will be deleted.
